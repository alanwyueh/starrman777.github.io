Automate Agility is brought to you by Eric Starr.

  Eric has over 21 years experience in IT.  His first 12 years was as a Java Web Application Developer.  The
  last 9 years, Eric has taken his development background and applied it in the area of Continuous Integration
  and Continuous Delivery.<br><br>
  
  Today Eric is working for a large healthcare company where he leads a team of Jenkins subject matter 
  experts that create a library of reusable methods that all internal development teams can use to rapidly build out
  their CI/CD pipelines.  This is called Jenkins Pipeline as Code or JPaC.

  Eric is on a never-ending journey of learning, applying and then teaching the best practices related to 
  DevOps.  There is no better way to learn something than to do it and then teach it.<br><br>
  
  Eric specialty is applying DevOps technical practices at an enterprise level.  It's a lot easier to introduce changes 
  in behavior, quality standards and best practices into a development team at a small startup.  It's
  a lot more challenging applying similar behaviors and quality standards across a large enterprise with varying technical
  skills and varying beliefs about delivering quality software to customers.

Eric's current interests and areas of focus are:
* Jenkins and Jenkins Pipeline as Code
* Docker and Dockerfile
* OSEv3
* Jekyyl site generation
* GitHub

# Family  
I have an amazing family.  My Wife's name is Shari.  We have been married for over 21 years.  I have 2 daughters:  Linnea who is a sophomore at Gardner-Webb and Isabel who is a senior in highschool.  I am not the only one in the Healthcare industry.  Shari and Linnea are both in Nursing school and both are CNAs.  Isabel is aspiring to start her own cosmetics business one day so she is planning on starting her college education with a Business degree.  We also have a dog named Samantha.
